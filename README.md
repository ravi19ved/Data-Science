# Data-Science

<i>This Data Science Repository contains all my data science learnings, notes, code snippets, implemented algorithms both in Python and R languages.  I also try to include cheat sheets and other useful stuff that is essential to learn data science and part of my learning.  The essential mathmatical and statistical fundamentals like Descriptive and Analytical Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus and Linear Programming concepts will also be included in the repository either in the form of notes or as an implemented code snippets. </i>
